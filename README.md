# [Computational Analysis of Gender Perception in the UK, Capstone Project](https://github.com/niranjanadeshpande/hansardscraping)

- Scraped parliamentary text transcripts from the Hansard website to analyze gender perception in the UK from 1800 – 2004 using BeautifulSoup
- Used Git as the platform to manage version control and streamline collaboration with teammates, ensuring organized code development and integration
- Visualized the percentage of male and female pronoun usage by decade to quantify gender perception using matplotlib, observing that male pronoun usage consistently exceeded female pronoun usage by a margin of 75% throughout the decades while observing a 5% rise in female pronoun usage from 1950 to 2004
- Developed wordclouds to generate insights that depicted the trends in terms associated with women from the 1800s – 2000s using fastText

# [NLP: Sentiment Analysis of Midnights, Taylor Swift’s album](https://github.com/nandhinishankarl/Sentiment-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Midnights%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20-3.ipynb)

- Employed the LyricsGenius library to scrape lyrics from 13 songs to analyze the overall sentiment of the Midnights album
- Utilized the re package to clean lyrics data by removing unnecessary words and characters
- Generated a bar graph of sentiment scores for all songs using matplotlib that identified 4 songs with negative scores and 9 songs with positive scores reflecting Taylor Swift’s happiness
