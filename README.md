- Made use of the ‘BeautifulSoup’ Python library to scrape information from Wikipedia for all Disney Films
- Saved data in the form of a csv file and cleaned it using Python’s pandas library
- Visualized top ten grossing films using Python's matplotlib library in the form of a bar graph
- The Lion King was the highest grossing Disney film till date

# [Project 2: Midnights Sentiment Analysis : Project Overview](https://github.com/nandhinishankarl/Sentiment-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Midnights%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20-3.ipynb)

- Scraped lyrics for all songs from the Midnights album using Python’s LyricsGenius library 
- Cleaned lyrics data by removing unnecessary words and characters/punctuations using Python's re package
- Created a wordcloud to see which words were prominent and frequently occurring
- Words like ‘love’, ‘fallin’ and ‘feel’ stood out, an indicator that the theme of the album is about falling in love
- Visualized sentiment scores for all songs using the ‘matplotlib’ library in the form of a bar graph
- 4 songs had negative scores, the highest being Anti-Hero, with a score of -0.9954. A song about self-deprecation
- 9 songs had positive scores, which is an indicator of Taylor Swift's happiness

# [Project 3: Spotify Song Popularity Analysis and Prediction - Billboard Hot 100 : Project Overview](https://github.com/nandhinishankarl/Nandhini_Portfolio/blob/main/Spotify_Billboard_Hot_100.ipynb)


- Scraped track information from Spotify for all songs on the Billboard Hot 100 list using Python’s Spotipy library 
- Every song has calculated audio features like danceability, song duration and energy.
- Visualized top 10 streamed artists using Python’s matplotlib library, SZA topped the list with 6 songs. 
- Created density plots for audio features using Python’s seaborn library, the average duration of a song on the Billboard list is 3.3 minutes. 
- Plotted a frequency graph based on song emotion using matplotlib, there are 56 sad songs and 44 happy songs.
- Defined the feature variables needed for prediction (audio features) and the target variable to be predicted (popularity score).
- Used the random forest model to predict popularity scores, the accuracy was 70%.
