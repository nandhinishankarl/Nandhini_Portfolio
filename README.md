# [Project 1: Uber Trip Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis): Project Overview](https://github.com/nandhinishankarl/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Uber%20Trip%20Analysis%20(NYC).ipynb)
 - Downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about uber trips from September 2014. 
 - Visualized the number of trips per weekday in the month of September using a histogram.
 - From the graph, it's evident that Monday was the busiest day.
 - Visualized the number of trips per hour in the month of September using a histogram. 
 - There wasn't much activity during night hours (12:00 AM to 5:00 AM). The count increased from 1:00 PM onwards and peaked at 6:00 PM.
 - It dipped from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM. 
 - Visualized the density of trips per location. 
 - From the scatter plot, it's evident that the density of rides is high in Manhattan and low in New Jersey.
