 - Downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about uber trips from September 2014. 
 - Visualized the number of trips per weekday in the month of September using a histogram.
 - From the graph, it's evident that Monday was the busiest day.
 - Visualized the number of trips per hour in the month of September using a histogram. 
 - There wasn't much activity during night hours (12:00 AM to 5:00 AM). The count increased from 1:00 PM onwards and peaked at 6:00 PM.
 - It dipped from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM. 
 - Visualized the density of trips per location. 
 - From the scatter plot, it's evident that the density of rides is high in Manhattan and low in New Jersey.

- Scraped lyrics from the list of urls using Genius.com's API 
- Cleaned the lyrics column by removing unnecessary words and characters/punctuations using Python's re (regular expresson) package
- Created a wordcloud to see which words were prominent and frequently occuring
- Words like love, fallin and feel stood out, an indicator that the theme of the album is about falling in love
- Calculated the overall sentiment score for each song using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer 
- Visualized the sentiment scores for all songs from the Midnights Album using the matplotlib library in the form of a bar graph 
- There were 4 songs had highly negative scores, the highest being Anti-Hero, a song about self-deprecation.
